THIS IS AN HTML ADVANCED PROJECT.

This project is about mastering the basics of HTML, the markup language that is used to structure a website.
In this project, I have used HTML to simply illustrate my skills and abilities of website creation.
During the work on this project, I had to make a lot of research on how to write an informative and concise readme file and by any means understand the requirements to finish this project.
This website can be accessed through all web browsers and its code is available on Github.
