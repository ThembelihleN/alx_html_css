    <h1>African Workforce</h1>
    <p>Africa is experiencing rapid population growth. It has the youngest workforce in the world, with an average
        age of 19 years, compared to 48 years in Germany or Japan. The continent is expected to have a workforce 
        of 1.1 billion by 2035 larger than China or India's. As a result, global technology companies are increasingly 
        seeing the continent as the next frontier for technology talent. Over the past three years, Twitter, Google, 
        Microsoft, IBM, Alibaba among others, have all announced plans to open tech hubs in Africa.</p>

        <h2> African Leadership International</h2>
    <p>These trends spurred ALI to partner with Holberton's advanced technology program two years ago to rapidly scale up the
        training of software engineers on the African continent. Over the past year, more than 95 000 students have 
        enrolled in African Leadership International's ALX skills acceleration program, scaling over 2 000 times in the
        last 15 months.</p>

        <h3>The Room</h3>
    <p>Through The ROOM, the placement division of African Leadership International, this world-class talent will then
        be matched and connected to global corporations seeking to build their technology teams, similar to how technology 
        companies today go to locations in Eastern Europe and India to find talent.</p>

    <p>With this acquisition, ALI expects to position itself as a leading source of technology talent on the African 
        continent, and one of the largest in the world. Holberton's technology has proven that it will play a crucial
        role in the ALI ecosystem. Students trained using Holberton's technology have been hired by companies like Apple, 
        Google, Tesla, LinkedIn, Dropbox, Pinterest, Rappi, and Nvidia.</p>
